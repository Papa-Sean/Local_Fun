# Local_Fun
Group Project 1: localfun.com <br>
For this project our team has created a website where the USER can search for the WEATHER and ACTIVITIES they can do in their local area. <br>
Activities include visiting local PARKS and viewing upcoming CONCERT events. <br>
At the top of the page has the "Welcome to Local Fun" greeting. <br>
The page includes a NAVIGATION bar at the top of the screen with a dropdown menu about the sections on the page. <br>
Towards the middle of the page, there are cards about each individual section on the page and a small caption describing the section.
At the bottom the USER can provide their CONTACT information if they have any questions.
Also at the bottom includes the contributors of the page.
