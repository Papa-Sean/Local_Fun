# Local_Fun
Group Project 1: localfun.com <br>
For this project our team has created a website where the USER can search for the WEATHER and ACTIVITIES they can do in their local area. <br>
Activities were to include visiting local PARKS and viewing upcoming CONCERT events. The NPS API for the local Parks section was only listing seven parks at a time. This meant the user had to submit numerous times to get all the parks. <br>
The top of the page has the "Welcome to Local Fun" greeting. <br>
Towards the middle of the page, there are cards about each individual section on the page and a small caption describing the section. <br>
At the bottom the USER can provide their CONTACT information if they have any questions. <br>
Also at the bottom includes the contributors of the page. <br>
Initially I had grand ideas to list local parks and amenities associated with them in. After not being able to find what I was looking for, we made the decision to add real time COVID numbers since that seems to be the metric that determine whether or not we leave the house in 2020.
ID Covid API <br>
Review API Documentation <br>
Acquire APIKey/Access <br>
Investigate data structure <br>

ID what data I wanted to display <br>
Created HTML home for API data <br>
Created a function to pull Country name - date - new cases - new deaths <br>
Created an html element on script page <br>

Would not run with covid API, it hit the cutting room floor for now <br>
One thing that was carefully monitored was coordinating push updates. Everyone made sure to alert the team prior to posting to ensure consistancy throughout the project. <br>
